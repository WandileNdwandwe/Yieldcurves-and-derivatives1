## Yield curves

The level of the yield curve, which initially declined notably and then flattened somewhat from 23 March 2020 to 3 June, again moved higher and steepened to early July amid renewed risk aversion, in particular beyond the five-year maturity range. Thereafter, the level of the yield curve moved slightly lower once more to 11 September 2020, while maintaining a steep slope. The short end reflected the lower repo rate and increased money market liquidity, whereas the 7â€“10-year maturity range discounted higher risk premiums and increased government borrowing. The yield gap, measured as the difference between yields at the extreme long and short-ends of the curve, narrowed from 803 basis points on 23 March 2020 to 701 basis points on 3 June before widening again to 800 basis points on 11 September.
